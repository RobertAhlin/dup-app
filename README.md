## 🌟 Vision

> “DUP helps educators and learners follow structured skill-building journeys with visual progress tracking and milestone-based development — so that every step in the learning process feels meaningful, clear, and empowering.”

Our goal is to create a platform that supports upskilling through clarity, modularity, and smart progression design. Inspired by tools like [Loops Education](https://loopseducation.com), DUP is being built to combine engagement, structure, and accessibility.
